## Avenir Testing Framework 2.0
New and Updated Testing Framework for User Interface Testing at Avenir Tech!

**Current Maintainer:** [@nevinjojo](https://github.com/nevinjojo)

### Installation
You can install the framework by executing the `install` file in the root directory:
```
$ ./install
```

#### **What the installation file does:**
- create directories to store scripts, screenshot, and result files
- Install Homebrew if not already installed (assuming you are using Mac. If not try installing Linuxbrew)
- Install YAML
- Install Ruby
- Install Chromedriver
- Install Selenium WebDriver Ruby Gem (if not already installed)
- Install Codacy Coverage to test framework coverage (You might need to sudo privilege for this)

**Note:** If one of the installation filed, try manually installing them. Make sure that the version of the installation matches the version specified in `install` file.

### Usage
To run the framework you need at least one test script (int he format of `.txt`). Check out the commands that you can execute in the test script in the Commands section.
You can execute the test script by executing the `run` file in the root directory:
```
$ ./run
```

### File Structure (after successful installation)

```

#### Framework execution argument options
**Specify test script(s)**
The run file accepts a range of flags and arguments (most of them optional). To run the script stored inside `testFile.txt` in the scripts directory, run the following command:
```
$ ./run scripts/testFile.txt
```

You can either run a single script like mentioned above or recursively run an entire directory of test suite(s) by simple mentioning the directory:
```
$ ./run scripts/
```

You can also use the `-s` flag to specify the test script(s):
```
$ ./run -s scripts/testFile.text
```

**Specify results directory**
You can use the `-d` flag to specify the directory where the results will be stored:
```
$ ./run -d results/path/to/results/dir/ scripts/testFile.txt
```
This will create a directory (with the current timestamp) and store the results in that directory. If results directory is not specified it will default to `results/` directory to store the results.

**Specify test browser**
`-b` flag will allow you to specify the test browser (`chrome|safari|firefox|iexplorer`). Default browser is Chrome
```
$ ./run -b chrome scripts/testFile.txt
```

**Set results directory to Dropbox**
This is so that the results can be accessed from multiple devices. You will need to check/change the path/to/dropbox in run file underneath -p option. 
```
$ ./run -p scripts/testFile.txt
```

**Note:** Make sure that you specify the test script(s) at the ned of the command like the examples given above. This is because the flags need to be set before specifying the test scripts.

### Some things to note
- The testing framework was built using the Ruby gem Selenium. At the time of building the framework, the version of ruby being used is ruby `2.5.0p0`
- The ChromeDriver version that is being used is `2.37`. When the install script is run it will automatically download the 2.37 version if it is not already using that version.
- The only gem that is currently being used needs for running the system is `selenium-webdriver`
- Some of the directories (such as `results/` and `screenshots/`) are ignored by `.gitignore` (These files will not be present when the repository is pulled from or pushed to). These folders are necessary for the proper function of the framework. The `install` script should take care of the creation of these directories (if they don't exist).
- Running the tests on Safari for the first time might return an error. This is usually because 'remote automationâ€™ might not be allowed in your version of safari. To allow remote automation:
    - Open Safari
    - Go to Develop in the tools bar
    - Click on â€˜Allow Remote Automationâ€™
- Some of the elements in the system does not have IDs (or have abnormal IDs generated by Symfony). At the moment, classes or xpaths are used instead tp handle those cases. These might have to be fixed for efficient usage of the testing framework. Some of these elements are:
    - Menu links
    - 'New' Buttons
    - 'Download' Button
    - Select2 Text Fields
    - Login Button - Commodity

### Troubleshooting

If the test scripts created did not run properly, it could be because of the following reasons:

- **Test scripts are old and had been run before:** some of the test scripts might had been run before and so the database might already have the same inputs saved (i.e. system not allowing duplicate inputs).
    - **Solution:** update the test script with new values.
- **The test script might contain unknown commands/ input types (or typos):** The framework ignores commands does not match the known commands. This might affect the commands that follows the typo command.
    - **Solution:** Check for typos in the command
    - Make sure that the commands such as `date + 2` have spaces between each parameter.
    - Ensure that the command is entered in the order the table above specifies.
- **The commands in main.rb might be using xpath instead of IDs:** This is because those elements does not have any IDs - can be fixed by adding IDs to those elements and changing the script command to look for IDs (more reliable)
- **Server is taking too much time to load:** The only solution to this problem is to add explicit wait times to the commands in main.rb file. The framework already implements explicit wait times at places where it is necessary (**N.B.** donâ€™t use sleep/ explicit waits unless required, or it will slow down the tests).

For any other issues with the framework or suggestions on improving the framework, mention the current maintainer or create an issue.

**Happy Testing!** ðŸ˜Ž
